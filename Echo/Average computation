Given N integers, compute their average correct to three decimal places. 

Input Format
The first line contains an N integer, .
lines follow,N each containing a single integer. 

Output Format
Display the average of the integers,N rounded off to three decimal places.

Input Constraints

1<= N <= 500
-10000 <=x <10000 (  x refers to elements of the list of integers for which the average is to be computed) 

Sample Input

4
1
2
9
8

Sample Output

5.000

Explanation
The '4' in the first line indicates that there are four integers whose average is to be computed. The average = (1 + 2 + 9 + 8)/4 = 20/4 = 5.000 (correct to three decimal places) 
Please include the zeroes even if they are redundant (e.g. 0.000 instead of 0).

The output for this statement is :

read b
sum=0
for (( i=1 ; i<=$b ; i++ ))
do
  read a
  let "sum+=$a"
   
done
printf "%.3f" $(echo $sum/$b | bc -l)
